# Brazilian Houses Rent Prediction

## Problem Description

In this ML project, Brazilian Houses data is used to predict rent prices. Being able to predict a house based on its descriptors such as number of rooms, area etc. is useful for both renters, landlords and realtors. This repo shows the training of two ML models (XGBoost and Random Forest) using a clean OpenML dataset, which sourced from Kaggle. 

## Files

Model files and embedding binaries are stored in `bin` folder.
Dataset is stored in `data` folder.


## Dependency Management

To train and run all the scripts, you should first install pipenv as: <br>
`pip install pipenv` <br>

Then, in the directory for the project, run:
`pipenv install`

This will create a virtual environment and install all needed libaries. Also, `requirements.txt` file is provided if you want to use different dependency management software.
